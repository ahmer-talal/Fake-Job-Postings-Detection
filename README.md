**ðŸ§  Fake Job Postings Detection â€“ Machine Learning Practice Project**

Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent job postings using Python. This practice project focuses on real-world fraud detection techniques through systematic data cleaning, feature engineering, and model comparison.

ðŸ”Ž Highlights

Cleaned and prepared job posting data (handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling).

Explored correlations between job attributes and fraud likelihood.

Trained and compared multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Achieved 95%+ accuracy using ensemble methods.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Notebook: Jupyter / Google Colab

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Fraudulent postings often had incomplete descriptions and unrealistic salary offers.

Company profile and benefits sections strongly correlate with fraud probability.

Ensemble models like Random Forest performed best on test data.
